This analysis explores the landscape of electricity production in the US spanning from 2000 - 2020, highlighting the diverse sources used to meet energy demands. The analysis used the Energy dataset from Our World in Data (OWID) and involved data cleaning, and transformation using Excel while exploratory data analysis and visualizations were carried out using Tableau, and insights were presented in PowerPoint. Central to this analysis involved looking at the environmental challenge posed by fossil fuel sources, responsible for carbon dioxide emissions, and the role played by the US, as well as the measures being taken to mitigate this issue. The analysis revealed that despite fossil fuels still accounting for a substantial 60% of electricity generation there is a growing trend towards renewable energy sources and as a result, greenhouse gas emissions have decreased a notable 26%. An important step in the pursuit of a more sustainable energy system.
